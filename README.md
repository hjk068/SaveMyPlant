# SaveMyPlant
This is a project for GardenHacks2021 by Hyun Jin Kim and Sunghee Kim. "SaveMyPlant" is an android app for gardeners who want to share their concerns about their gardens, ask for advice, and show off their gardening results to other gardeners through chat rooms.

Additional Description:

## Inspiration
Most gardeners have their own gardens, which means that it is more of an individual job rather than a collaborative one. Therefore, when someone faces difficulties in taking care of their plants, it is hard for them to find a solution. This is why we thought a platform for gardeners to discuss their problems would be helpful for gardeners.

## What it does
This application is a platform for gardeners to share information and get advice about gardening through chat.

## How we built it
We used Android Studio to create an application and then used firebase to allow users to sign in, sync data, and store files.

## Challenges we ran into
We have never used Kotlin before, but we took the risk to build an application based on Kotlin by using Android studio.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to build two different chat rooms with different purposes, which took most of our time building this application. 

## What we learned
We learned how to use firebase and connect it to Android Studio. Both of us never used firebase before, so we had to learn by looking at different references online.

## What's next for SaveMyPlant
Another feature that we are working on is the profile feature, a personal page for users to upload profile pictures and change their usernames.
